# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1
---

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I needed to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

## Dependencies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* Leaflet.js (https://leafletjs.com/)
* Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/)

## Installation:

1. Clone the project from Github

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
